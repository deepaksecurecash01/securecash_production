            <h2><strong>* YOU MUST WEAR PLAIN CLOTHES, NO UNIFORMS.</strong></h2>
            <h4>Clothing</h4>
            <p>All banking couriers are to wear suitable clothing and must meet the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must be of a neat and casual appearance</li>
                <li>Not have any distinguishing logos or designs that will make you stand out in public</li>
                <li>Not be of a loud colour</li>
                <li>Not ripped or torn and clean</li>
                <li>Must be in good condition</li>
                <li>All footwear must be enclosed and appropriate to run in</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Appearance</h4>
            <p>All banking couriers are to be well groomed this includes the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All males must be clean shaven unless with a beard that is kept neat and trim</li>
                <li>Excessive make up is not to be worn</li>
                <li>All tattoos are to be coved up and are not to be on display, this is in regards to security</li>
                <li>Excessive jewellery is not to be worn</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Good personal presentation is crucial and important. Always ensure that clothing worn is neat, clean, in good repair with no offensive words or images. Polish your shoes often if necessary.</p>
            <p>Banking couriers are to also be mindful of personal hygiene as well. They are required to wash regularly to ensure that you have clean hair with no body or breathe odours.</p>
            <h4>Attitude</h4>
            <p>All banking couriers must have good customer service skills; a high level of importance is to be placed on the courier having these skills.</p>
            <p>Banking couriers that do not have good customer service skills are deemed to be not suitable.</p>
            <h4>Etiquette</h4>
            <p>Our company prides itself on the high level of customer service that we provide to all our clients. All banking couriers are to always be polite and helpful to our clients.</p>
            <p>Each time a banking courier greets a customer or potential customer whether it is by phone or face to face, the banking courier should always try and greet the person by name if known, or at least acknowledge them with a good morning or good afternoon.</p>
            <p>If the banking courier does not know the name, then they are to make an effort to remember the name.</p>
            <h4>Professionalism</h4>
            <p>To maintain our level of professionalism, it is not appropriate to instigate or encourage gossip or conversations of a personal nature.</p>
            <p>If a client wishes to engage in this type of conversation, then the banking courier should politely let the client talk and when the opportunity presents itself, excuse yourself by saying something like you had "better be getting on with the day".</p>
            <p>It is not appropriate to encourage gossip about another client, etc.</p>
            <p>If the client wishes to complain about the service or about another banking courier, then they are to be directed to call and/or email the area manager if necessary.</p>
            <p>Never engage in responding to the client or encouraging them to disclose more information. Do not give them your opinion.</p>
            <h4>Personal Phone Number & Email Address</h4>
            <p>You will never give your personal telephone number or email address to any customer under any circumstances!</p>
            <p>If requested, the only number you will ever give to a client is the head office number 1300 SECURE or email address customers@securecash.com.au</p>
            <h4>Smoking</h4>
            <p>As an employer, we have a duty in accordance with Occupational Health and Safety legislation to provide a safe working environment and to protect the health of all staff from hazards at the workplace.</p>
            <p>To protect the health of all banking couriers from the ill effects of cigarette smoke at work, the Company has adopted a policy of providing a smoke free workplace.</p>
            <p>Smoking is prohibited in all work places other than those designated as smoking areas. This includes company owned equipment and vehicles and client premises.</p>
            <p>It must be stressed, however, that breaching this policy will be dealt with in the same manner as a breach of any other Occupational Health and Safety Policy.</p>
            <h4>Fitness For Work</h4>
            <p>We are concerned at the increasing alcohol and drug misuse in the community.</p>
            <p>Banking couriers are prohibited from working at any time if their ability to effectively and safely perform their work is impaired by the influence of alcohol, drugs or any other substance.</p>
            <p>The Company recognises that alcohol and drug dependence can be an illness and encourages treatment and rehabilitation of those persons affected by such a dependency. It is our policy to support and encourage those seeking rehabilitation from alcohol and drug dependency.</p>
            <p>If in an opinion of the Company, a banking couriers ability is impaired by alcohol, drugs or any other substance then that banking courier will be stood down until proven otherwise.</p>
            <p>Every banking courier has the authority and responsibility to report to their manager if in their opinion they or any other banking courier may be under the influence or be affected by any substance that impairs the ability for a banking courier to perform their duties safely.</p>
            <p>The cost of all tests and rehabilitation related to substance abuse will be the responsibility of the banking courier.</p>

            <p>Survival is the first rule during an armed hold-up. All banking couriers must protect themselves, not money or goods.</p>
            <p>The following steps below are to be strictly adhered to during an armed hold-up.</p>
            <p><strong>Stand Still</strong></p>
            <p>Identify the situation. The banking courier is to keep their hands where they can be seen and do not make any sudden or quick moves. Stand slightly side on to the robber. (a submissive position).</p>
            <p><strong>Obey The Robber's Instructions</strong></p>
            <p>Do exactly what you are told; allow the robber/s to leave.</p>
            <p><strong>Remain Calm And Quiet</strong></p>
            <p>Speak only when spoken to. Avoid shouting or provoking the robber. Be submissive and avoid drawing attention to yourself. Avoid staring at the robber and/or making direct eye contact.</p>
            <p><strong>Observe, If You Can, Safely</strong></p>
            <p>Make a mental note of the robber’s appearance including, hair colour, height, weight, clothing, race, age and type of weapon (Assess height markings on the doorway).</p>
            <p>Look for identifying characteristics including scars, tattoos and speech patterns. If it is safe to do so, write down the license number and the make, model, colour and year of the get-away car.</p>
            <p><strong>Stay Out Of The Danger Area</strong></p>
            <p>The robber is in control; do not try to outsmart them. During the holdup, do not investigate out of curiosity or bravado.</p>
            <p><strong>Stay Where You Are. Do Not Chase.</strong></p>
            <p>Leave this to the police. Observe the direction of departure and getaway car details only if safe to do so.</p>
            <p><strong>Call The Police</strong></p>
            <p>When it is safe call the police, telephone 000, make a full report to the police before discussing the hold-up with other staff.</p>
            <p><strong>Seal Off The Hold-Up Area</strong></p>
            <p>Evidence must not be touched. Any interference may destroy vital clues.</p>
            <p><strong>Ask Witnesses To Remain</strong></p>
            <p>The banking courier should ask all witnesses to remain until the police arrive.</p>
            <h4>Identifying Robbers</h4>
            <p>The police will want to interview all witnesses to an armed hold-up to try and establish the identity of the robber as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>During the robbery the banking courier is to observe the following details about the robber only if they can while doing exactly as directed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Height</li>
                <li>Weight</li>

            <h4>Handing Over Money During A Robbery</h4>
            <p>Money is only to be handed over to an assailant if the banking courier is over powered, or if there is immediate threat to the life or well being (armed hold up) of the banking courier or to the life and well being of others in the vicinity.</p>
            <p>SecureCash must be notified immediately after the event taking place.</p>
            <h4>Post Hold Up Procedures</h4>
            <p>Following a hold-up the following procedures are in place so that first aid can be administered, psychologically traumatised persons can be treated quickly and appropriately, and the relevant authorities contacted.</p>
            <p>Below are the post hold-up procedures to be followed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As soon as it is safe to do so, the banking courier must contact the police and if necessary ambulance on the emergency number 000</li>
                <li>Contact the Secure Cash head office and advise them of the situation</li>
                <li>Injured and/or traumatised persons including members of the public should be given first aid and comforted</li>
                <li>Evidence must be left undisturbed, cordon off the crime area until the police have arrived</li>
                <li>Evidence is anything that the robber has come into contact with</li>
                <li>Ask all those who witnessed the crime to remain at the scene until the police arrive, if any witnesses want to leave the scene take down their names and phone numbers</li>
                <li>Ask witnesses to note down a description of the robber and the words used in the crime as soon as practicable, first impressions are vital</li>
                <li>The banking courier and other victims and witnesses should contact their families to advise them of the situation</li>
                <li>Assist members of the public with contacting their families or help them to their vehicles or arrange transport for them</li>
                <li>Make sure that you seek access to a professional post trauma counselling service; or take the option of seeing your own doctor or psychologist</li>
                <li>Inform other banking couriers about what has occurred and update this as necessary</li>

            <p>The policy in short form covers all banking couriers for cash carried up to AUD $50,000 (Fifty Thousand Dollars).</p>
            <p>A banking courier will not be covered at all, even up to $50,000 if they carry $0.01 over.</p>
            <p>You, the banking courier will be liable for the whole $50,000 + every $0.01 over that you carry!</p>
            <p>A banking courier is to never accept 1c more than this amount from any client during a collection.</p>
            <p>If a client hands a banking courier more than $50,000 the following is to occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The banking courier is to contact their manager and notify them</li>
                <li>The banking courier is to request the client breakdown the total amount into a number of smaller amounts each limited $50,000 in cash</li>
                <li>Each amount is to be placed into the appropriate tamper evident serial numbered satchel</li>
                <li>The courier is to take one satchel at a time to the bank, and once banked return to the client to collect the next satchel</li>
                <li>Each satchel is to be banked in sequence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The whole policy is void if you carry even 1c over the limit of $50,000.</p>
            <p>Cheques do not have a dollar limit on them and can be of an unlimited amount unless they are written out to “CASH”.</p>
            <p>Any cheque written out to cash must be treated as cash and must be limited to $50,000.</p>
            <p>Cash is not covered in an unattended vehicle and must accompany the banking courier at all times.</p>
            <p>You are not covered if cash is stolen from your vehicle and the banking courier will be financially responsible for any cash that is stolen.</p>
            <h4>In Summary</h4>
            <p>At no time is the banking courier to have 1c more in their possession than $50,000 AUD in cash.</p>
            <p>If a banking courier finds that a client wishes to deposit more than $50,000 AUD in cash then two collections are to be made, the docket book must reflect this second collection.</p>

            <h4>Security Of Keys</h4>
            <p>From time to time a banking courier may be required be issued with a key to enter into a clients premises and/or to open a safe.</p>
            <p>Keys are to never be labelled with any location information and must be identified only by code.</p>
            <p>Keys are not to be kept on the same key ring as keys for other clients and/or to be kept on a chain.</p>
            <p>Keys are the responsibility of the banking courier and the custodian of the key/s is 100% financially liable if they are lost or stolen, this may include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reissuing of the lost key/s to all previous key holders</li>
                <li>The replacement or opening of the affected safe</li>
                <li>The replacement and reissuing of door locks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Banking couriers are to ensure that the key for a particular service is secured at all times when not in use and is immediately returned and re-secured to the vehicle when it is no longer required.</p>
            <p>Keys are not permitted to be secured with any cash.</p>
            <h4>Security Of Information</h4>
            <p>All information that is entrusted to a banking courier is to be kept out of view to the public, this can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bank tellers</li>
                <li>People in bank queue, (Especially security guards from rival companies & potential robbers)</li>
                <li>Other clients</li>
                <li>Friends and/or family</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Under no circumstances is confidential information to be left on display in a vehicle regardless if the vehicle is attended on not, this includes but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any operating procedures</li>
                <li>Run lists</li>
                <li>Completed dockets</li>
                <li>Client information and/or contact details</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bank tellers are to never be given and/or trusted with any sensitive or confidential information pertaining clients or operations.</p>
            <p>Just like they do not give and/or trust us with accessing information pertaining to the bank accounts of our clients.</p>
            <p>Remember; you are not the only banking courier that a bank teller speaks to in their day, and you cannot guarantee that any information you have given them will not be passed on.</p>
            <p>There's an old saying 'Loose lips sinks ships'.</p>
            <h4>Security Of Cash</h4>
            <p>Cash that has not been banked must not be left in vehicle unattended. All un-banked cash must be in the possession of the banking courier at all times.</p>
            <p>All cash that is collected must be stored during transit in a lock box.</p>
            <p>The lock box is to be secured to the vehicle in either one of the following methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welded to the structure of the vehicle</li>
                <li>Bolted to the structure of the vehicle</li>
                <li>Chained to the structure of the vehicle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All lock boxes must be locked by the means of a key or combination padlock. Keys and/or codes for the padlocks must never be left in the vehicle and must always be in the possession of the banking courier.</p>
            <p>All lock boxes must be out of view from the public and must be covered by a blanket or sheet if they can be seen through any window of the vehicle.</p>
            <p>All lock boxes must be made of steel and have the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be of no less than 2 mm in thickness</li>
                <li>Constructed by a reputable manufacturer</li>
                <li>Be able to be locked via a padlock</li>
                <li>Have provisions to be able to be secured to a vehicle chassis by chain or by internal screws</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Confidentiality Agreements</h4>
            <p>Basically confidential information means all information belonging to the Company which is confidential and commercially sensitive, including but not limited to information concerning the nature, location and capabilities of clients, pricing structure, operating procedures, methods and strategies.</p>
            <p>All banking couriers must agree to a confidentiality agreement as part of their induction and renew it periodically throughout their employment;</p>

            <p>If the banking courier accepts such a satchel then complete and total liability of the content of the satchel transfers to the banking courier if the satchel is deficient.</p>
            <p><strong>Broken Satchels</strong></p>
            <p>On occasions an express deposit satchel (EDS) will break or become temper evident due to the use of a deposit chute.</p>
            <p>When this happens we are to provide a free pickup andreturn of the EDS for the client when convenient to us.</p>
            <p>Depending on the nature of the broken satchel, the banking courier may stand in front of the bank teller and re-bag the satchel and deposit back into the EDC or return the broken satchel back to the client.</p>
            <p>Usually the client will receive a phone call from the bank that it was deposited at, the client will in turn contact either the area manager or head office direct.</p>
            <p>Depending on the relationship with the branch in question, the banking courier may require authorisation to pick up the EDS, the authorisation must be in writing using the customers letterhead.</p>
            <p>This letter is to be signed and then faxed or emailed back to bank.</p>
            <p>If a satchel is to be returned back to the client, then it must be placed into another type of tamper evident satchel, witnessed by the bank teller and then the serial number of this satchel be recorded on the ‘White Docket’ and ‘Yellow Docket’ with the bank teller keeping the ‘Yellow Docket’ for their records.</p>
            <p><strong>Raw Cash</strong></p>
            <p>Under no circumstances are banking couriers to ever collect ‘raw’ and/or ‘open’ cash that is to be deposited from a client.</p>
            <p>All cash must be contained within a sealed (not open) serial number tamper evident satchel of some description.</p>

            <p>The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act was enacted in 2006.</p>
            <p>AUSTRAC is Australia's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator and specialist financial intelligence unit. AUSTRAC is short for Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.</p>
            <p>AUSTRAC works together with Australian industries and businesses in their compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislation.</p>
            <p>The broad purpose of the AML Act is to regulate financial transactions in a way that will help detect and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
            <p>As Australia's financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC contributes to investigative and law enforcement work to fight financial crime and prosecute criminals in Australia and overseas.</p>
            <p>Money laundering involves injection of funds generated from illegal activities into the legitimate financial system in order to hide or disguise the criminal source of those funds.</p>
            <p>Terrorism financing is the use of money, which may or may not be generated from criminal activity, for financing terrorist activities.</p>
            <p>As a cash in transit provider, SecureCash is obligated under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 to perform several activities.</p>
            <p>SecureCash is required to develop and maintain a program which covers the responsibilities and illustrates how the responsibilities will be met according to the Act.</p>
            <p>SecureCash is also responsible to maintain appropriate records and to submit reports to AUSTRAC.</p>
            <p>The AML Act adopts a risk-based approach. This approach means that the reporting entity such as SecureCash need to decide how best to assess and mitigate the risk of money laundering and financing of terrorism through its business. Reporting entities are required to undertake a comprehensive assessment of these risks relative to their businesses.</p>
            <p>SecureCash is required to demonstrate to AUSTRAC that they have carried out such an assessment and have a program in place to identify, mitigate and manage the risk of their products or services being used to facilitate money laundering or the financing of terrorism.</p>
            <p>The key obligations of a reporting entity such as SecureCash include record keeping requirements in relation to transactional records and compliance reporting to AUSTRAC.</p>
            <p>The following are required of the Company:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have prescribed procedures in place to verify a customer’s identity before providing a designated service</li>
                <li>Develop and maintain an AML/CTF program</li>
                <li>Have in place an AML/CTF ACO</li>
                <li>Comply with record keeping requirements in relation to records of identification procedures and records about AML/CTF programs</li>
                <li>Report to AUSTRAC suspicious matters and transactions above a certain threshold</li>
                <li>Undertake ongoing customer due diligence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An important aspect of the compliance of a reporting entity is the AML/CTF program. An AML/CTF program is divided into two parts:</p>
            <p><strong>Part A</strong></p>
            <p>Designed to identify, mitigate and manage the risk that a reporting entity may reasonably face that the provision of designated services might involve or facilitate money laundering or financing of terrorism.</p>
            <p>Included in Part A will be the requirement for a reporting entity to;</p>
            <p>Have an employee due diligence program for screening prospective employees as well as other employees who may be in a position to facilitate money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
            <p>Have an AML/CTF risk awareness training program so that employees receive appropriate training on the money laundering and terrorist financing risk that the reporting entity may face.</p>
            <p>Designate a person at management level as the AML/CTF ACO.</p>
            <p>Part A of the AML/CTF program must be approved by and be subject to ongoing oversight by the reporting entity’s senior management. It must also be subject to regular independent review which may be conducted internally or externally.</p>
            <p><strong>Part B</strong></p>
            <p>Sets out the reporting entity’s customer identification procedures. These procedures include prescribed processes for the collection and verification of “Know Your Customer Information” and requirements for a reporting entity to have appropriate risk based systems and controls to determine what (if any) other information will be collected.</p>
            <p>A reporting entity is required to consider certain factors when identifying its exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing. These include consideration of its customer types, the types of designated services it provides and the methods by which those services are delivered.</p>
            <p>All staff will need to be aware of their activities in the course of their work in relation to anti money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
            <p>Most of the obligations for SecureCash will be the responsibility of the ACO; however, as the day to day contact for our clients, our staff have the opportunity to observe any suspicious matter. The front line staff may also be witness to suspicious activities or receive suspicious queries from clients.</p>
            <p>If any of our staff observe suspicious activities or receive suspicious queries, they should report the matter to SecureCash immediately for further investigation.</p>
            <p>Such suspicious queries could be where the client requests a collection from an unfamiliar location, or a delivery to an unfamiliar destination.</p>

            <p>The nature of the industry which is cash in transit means that banking couriers are often exposed to large and heavy amount of coins to collect.</p>
            <p>There are guidelines in place to ensure that banking couriers are lifting and handling these collections in the correct manner using the correct equipment. </p>
            <p>As a general rule, a carry bag is to be used when transporting collections from the client’s premises to the banking couriers vehicle. </p>
            <p>A carry bag is to be used for collections weighing less than 7 kilos in total. For instance, if a client has 10 bags to collect, the total weight of the 10 bags must not exceed 7 kilos. If the total weight exceeds 7 kilos, then a wheeled carry bag and/or trolley must be used. </p>
            <p>Banking couriers should never lift a full carry bag into their car.</p>
            <p>Some clients will always have heavy coin to collect. Notes will be made on your run to highlight these existing clients, but if a new client has this type of collection, the banking courier must make this known to the area manager so that your run can be updated.</p>
            <p>The banking courier also has a duty to inform the area manager that a client is preparing bags too heavy for collection so that the client can be informed if necessary.</p>
            <p>In the event of a collection occurring at a known heavy coin client, the banking courier is expected to use their discretion and choose the most appropriate equipment to facilitate the job.</p>

            <p>SecureCash considers harassment of any form to be unacceptable behaviour which will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is also unlawful.</p>
            <p>SecureCash is therefore committed to action which ensures the absence of harassment in the workplace. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against any individual engaging in such conduct.</p>
            <p>Harassment involves any unwanted and unsolicited behaviour that torments someone else which the person at whom it is directed finds offensive, degrading or unpleasant.</p>
            <p>Sexual harassment is any form of unwanted sexual attention. Sexual harassment can be a single incident or unwanted attention such as touching or other physical contact, remarks with sexual connotations, smutty jokes, and request for sexual favours, leering or the display of offensive material.</p>
            <p>Some incidents of unwanted attention do not constitute sexual harassment until they are repeated</p>
            <p>An example is as follows:</p>
            <p>Continuous invitations to see that person outside of working hours after their intentions have been made clear that they do not want to associate with that person.</p>
            <p>Deliberate and continuous compliments in the nature of one’s appearance.</p>
            <p>Sexual harassment is against the law.</p>
            <p>A client must never be touched. The banking courier must be aware of any intentional contact with the client as it can be easily misconstrued that a friendly pat on the back is a sexual advance.</p>
            <p>If a client touches a banking courier and the banking courier is uncomfortable about the situation, then the banking courier is to notify the area manager immediately after they have left the clients premises.</p>
            <p>No banking courier is permitted to have a sexual relationship with a client.</p>
            <p>Any banking courier who experiences difficulties or are aware of incidents relating to harassment of any form and are not satisfied of the outcome after explaining the situation to their manager must contact the General Manager of SecureCash and report the incident.</p>

            <p>SecureCash offers a change order service to all it’s clients, there are several different ways in which these are provided;</p>
            <p>The client pre-arranges to have a change order collected by the banking courier at a bank of their choice, the banking courier simply goes to the bank first & collects change then delivers it to the client.</p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p>The client may give the banking courier funds upon their arrival to collect the clients banking, the banking courier is then to go to the bank, change the order into the required denominations and return it back to the client.</p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p>The client transfers the money for the change order into a nominated bank account. The banking courier withdraws the change order from the bank prior and delivers it to the client.</p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p>You, the banking courier, fund the money for the change order and have the amount requested made up prior to attending the clients premises. The banking courier delivers the change order and then <span style="text-decoration:underline;">MUST</span> get that same dollar amount in cash notes back from the customer.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the method used above, the client is encouraged to order the change prior from either of the two following methods;</p>
            <p>Online Services: <a href="https://www.securecash.com.au/onlineservices/">www.securecash.com.au/onlineservices</a><br>Telephone Services: <a href="tel:1300732873">1300 SECURE</a></p>
            <p>However the banking courier must be prepared to perform a change order for a client that has not been ordered prior.</p>
            <p>If the client does order the change via online/telephone services, it will be forwarded to you prior to the commencement of your shift. The client is encouraged to order change using online/telephone services so that you are able to plan your day better and to make sure the funds are available with the bank, and if at all possible fund the change order prior to arrival to save you time in advance.</p>
            <p>All change orders collected from the bank must be sealed in a a tamper proof serial numbered satchel either provided by the bank (usually one of the banks own EBD satchels), or a satchel provided by your manager.</p>
            <p>Remember, never handle raw cash, this includes large return change orders!</p>
            <p>(Obviously common sense is required, if the client hands you $200 in $50 notes that is easily counted for verification, then there is no need to place in a tamper evident satchel, the above is referring to large amounts that would take time to count and verify. i.e. $500 to $1000 that is made up of mixed denominations of coins and notes).</p>
            <p>Place the change order in the tamper evident bag and make sure it is sealed in front of the bank teller, make sure the bank teller writes down the serial number of the satchel in case there is a discrepancy.</p>
            <p>Upon delivery of the change to client, the client will check that bag is sealed then check that funds are correct when they are satisfied that all is correct they must sign your copy of the "White Docket" as confirmation of delivery.</p>
