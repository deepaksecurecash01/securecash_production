But how safe is your money in the hands of these couriers?`,

However, the design was later proved to be flawed.`,
              `Through the years, due to invention and consistent innovations, armoured cars and CIT trucks have become what they are today. Some armoured cars have bulletproof body frames, while other vehicles only have bulletproofed windscreens.`,

It also advertises the fact that you may have more money kept inside. By seeing the armoured vehicle and its uniformed crew, this would cause suspicion and invite ideas for thieves and robbers to plot a crime: they can note down routines, patterns, record time and date of transport. If they will not consider robbing the armoured van, they can certainly be organizing a scheme to break into your office anytime.`,

      your funds. It also gives us more time to assess potential disruptions to obtain a much smoother cash delivery flow
      during the requested date.</p>

      easily trace it back to the issuing bank. Once we can verify the problem, you can contact them and they will be happy to

        How Much Notice?
      </h3>
      <h4>If I want a cash order (where you deliver cash to my location), how long in advance do I need to give you the booking?</h4>
      <p>We need 2 business days notice so the bank can arrange to order the cash in.</p>

      <h3 >
        Short-Changed?
      </h3>
      <h4>What happens if the cash you deliver is less than we ordered?</h4>
      <p>We only deliver cash that is sealed in tamper-evident satchels. We collect it from your bank in those sealed satchels. This protects you because any shortfall can easily be traced back to the issuing bank. You would contact them and they will reimburse you accordingly.</p>
