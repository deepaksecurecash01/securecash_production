        You can start using this technology to service your own clients as an
        eDockets Licensee. We know first hand how annoying it is to have a
        mountain of paperwork cluttering your office and dealing with dozens of
        seperate spreadsheets to manage your client listings. With this system
        all the paper work is gone and yet all the information is so much easier
        to access! <br />
        <br />
        eDockets provides you a full database to better manage your Operations
        and providing clients with their own dedicated access to be able to
        manage their own services by booking Extra Pickups, submitting their
        Change Orders and Cancelling a service when it is no longer required.
        You are also able to completely organise your daily operations with Run
        Sheets that feed directly to the Operator in the app and Automated
        Invoicing where charges automatically generate with the transactions you
        perform and instant export at the end of the month, just to name a
        couple of the benefits! <br />
        <br />
